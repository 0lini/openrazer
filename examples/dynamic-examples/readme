How to use dynamic-examples

This is a way of storing profiles as files, so you won't have to recompile any code.
The fps profile is a modified version of FPS profile found in Razer's program.



Usage:

As root, pipe the .template file to ./dynamic

Example

$ sudo su
<enter password>
# cat fps.template | ./dynamic

You should see you keyboard change colors

Animations are not supported (yet?)


Making own profiles:
The syntax of dynamic is as follows:
<command> <params>
command:
  0 - exit
  1 - set color by XY, params: <x> <y> <r 0-255> <g 0-255> <b 0-255>, 
    where XY=(1,1) is the ~ key, and (1, 0) is ESC
  2 - set color by string, params <r 0-255> <g 0-255> <b 0-255> <keys>
Every .template must end with "0" in order to exit the program!


Example
A template like
2
255 255 255
FJ
1 
1 0 
255 0 0
0
will set F and J to white, and ESC to red.
